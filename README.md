# simulador_derrape_formula_1_mlapp
This repository contains the documentaiton and investigation necessary for the development of a simulation of drift from a Formula 1 
circuit in Sao Paulo in relation with the mass, velocity and friction coeffient present when an automovile goes in the curves of the circuit.
The user will input the variables mass, velocity and friction in the graphic interface, then press on the Start green 
bottom and the program will display the circuit and the trajectory of the automobile and wether it gets out 
of the circuit or it will remain on track.
